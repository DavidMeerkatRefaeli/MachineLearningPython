# MachineLearningPython
Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng in coursera, adopted to Python

Neural-Network exercise in the 2nd part of Ex.3 was joined into Ex.4 - under the name NN.py

SVM exercise was done with Sklearn (File: SVM.py). I plan to try and implement the SMO algorithm sometime later. 

Ex.7 was divided into KMeans.py and PCA.py
